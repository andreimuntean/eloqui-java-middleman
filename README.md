myo-java
========

Using the unofficial Java bindings made by @NicholasAStuart, we have a Java application which transforms the gesture and gyroscope data input from 2 Myo wristbands into text.

The text is then served sequentially and available to access in localhost:3000/test
The mobile does text-to-speech.
